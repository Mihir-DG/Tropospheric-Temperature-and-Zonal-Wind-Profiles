# Tropospheric-Temperature-and-Zonal-Wind-Profiles

Evaluates tropospheric temperature and zonal wind pressure profiles over a variety of projections. **The final output is displayed in a report (PDF) entitled 'Temperature And Winds In The Troposhere' that can be found in the root directory**. 

The code is split up into 3 factions: 

1) Troposphere Winds:
- Zonal (Westerly) Wind Profiles
- Meridional (Northerly) Wind Profiles
- Anomalies: Looks at seasonal breaks from an annual average in profiles for both zonal and meridional winds.

2) Temperature: Creates spatial profiles for temperature across various projections at different altitudes during different seasons.

3) Thermal Wind (tempZonal): Looks at the relationship between zonal wind and temperature.
